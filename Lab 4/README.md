## Part D — Physical Interaction Design: Feast Automata

**\*\*\*Draw 5 sketches that explore different physical arrangements for your sensing and actuation.\*\*\***

<img width="908" height="512" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00d02dff-79c8-444c-b9a4-8ef5a5c28ac7" />

**\*\*\*What questions do these sketches raise? What do you need to physically prototype to answer them?\*\*\***

I made 5 sketches. Two of the sketches are different plays on the energetic suzan (a motor-powered lazy suzan). The third one is a conversation tracker that reveals which dining participant is talking the most or the least. The fourth idea was a kitchen timer that can account for multiple cooking steps. The final one is a camera enabled meat thermometer that will tell you whether your meat is likely to be cooked. These raise questions of the extent to which novelty and sillyness is welcome in dining experiences. 

**\*\*\*Pick one design to prototype and explain why.\*\*\***
I decided to pick the energetic suzan because it would be the most fun thing to build. It is silly because no one has thought to themselves (likely) "oh, I wish this lazy suzan was motor-powered". If this were an interpretive art piece, we would say that it is a commentary on the automation-first society, which rejects antiquity without consideration for whether a need truly exists. 

**\*\*\*Document your rough prototype with photos and/or video.\*\*\***

## Part 2

Following exploration and reflection from Part 1, complete the "looks like," "works like" and "acts like" prototypes for your design, reiterated below.

### Part E

#### Build & Integrate: Sensing + Actuation

For Part 2, build the Feast Automata interaction you developed in Part D by connecting sensing/input to physical actuation.

**Your prototype should:**
- Use at least one sensing or input device.
- Use servo-based physical actuation.
- Connect sensing and actuation into a meaningful interaction around eating, drinking, cooking, serving, or sharing food.
- Additional inputs, displays, LEDs, buttons, or other outputs are optional extensions.

**Document your system with:**
- Code for your sensing + actuation prototype: [`encoder_servo.py`](encoder_servo.py)
- Photos and/or video of the working prototype in action: https://youtube.com/shorts/cW6RVNn26EE?is=wfLIyasyHjL_reLD
- A simple interaction diagram or sketch showing how sensing and actuation are connected
- Written reflection: What did you learn about connecting sensing, movement, and physical form? What was fun, surprising, or challenging?

**Questions to consider:**
- How does your chosen sensor or input shape the physical response?
- How does the physical arrangement of the sensor and actuator change the interaction?
- What thresholds, timing, or movement patterns make the interaction feel clear or playful?
- What changes when you adjust the sensor placement or servo motion?

Iterate on the sensing, movement, and physical form, and document what you discover.

See encoder_accel_servo_dashboard.py in the Lab 4 folder for an optional example of chaining together three devices.

**`Lab 4/encoder_accel_servo_dashboard.py`**

#### Example Application: Windmill Coaster

Now that you have explored both sensing and actuation, here is a simple example that combines the two.

The **Windmill Coaster** uses a Qwiic distance/proximity sensor to detect when a cup is placed on a coaster. When the cup is detected, a servo motor animates a small windmill by sweeping it back and forth, turning an ordinary action during drinking into a playful physical interaction.

<p align="center">
    <img src="windmill_coaster11.gif" alt="Windmill Coaster Demo" width="400"/>
</p>


This example demonstrates a simple interaction pipeline:

**cup placed → distance sensor detects cup → servo actuates windmill**

Connect the Qwiic distance sensor to the Pi and connect the servo to Channel 0 of the Servo pHAT. Make sure the Servo pHAT is powered through its USB-C connection.

Run the example script:

```bash
python windmill_coaster.py
```

The script continuously reads the proximity value from the distance sensor. When the value passes a threshold, the servo begins animating the windmill. When the cup is removed, the servo stops and returns to its resting position.

You may need to adjust `CUP_THRESHOLD` in [`windmill_coaster.py`](windmill_coaster.py) depending on the size of your cup and the physical placement of the sensor. You can run `qwiic_distance.py` first to compare readings with and without a cup.

Use this example as a starting point. Change the sensor, movement, physical form, or dining interaction to create your own Feast Automata variation.

#### Optional Extensions

The following examples are optional resources if you want to add more inputs or outputs to your prototype.

##### Using Multiple Qwiic Buttons: Changing I2C Address (Physically & Digitally)

If you want to use more than one Qwiic Button in your project, you must give each button a unique I2C address. There are two ways to do this:

##### 1. Physically: Soldering Address Jumpers

On the back of the Qwiic Button, you'll find four solder jumpers labeled A0, A1, A2, and A3. By bridging these with solder, you change the I2C address. Only one button on the chain can use the default address (0x6F).

**Address Table:**

| A3 | A2 | A1 | A0 | Address (hex) |
|----|----|----|----|---------------|
|  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |    0x6F       |
|  0 |  0 |  0 |  1 |    0x6E       |
|  0 |  0 |  1 |  0 |    0x6D       |
|  0 |  0 |  1 |  1 |    0x6C       |
|  0 |  1 |  0 |  0 |    0x6B       |
|  0 |  1 |  0 |  1 |    0x6A       |
|  0 |  1 |  1 |  0 |    0x69       |
|  0 |  1 |  1 |  1 |    0x68       |
|  1 |  0 |  0 |  0 |    0x67       |
| ...| ...| ...| ... |     ...      |

For example, if you solder A0 closed (leave A1, A2, A3 open), the address becomes 0x6E.

**Soldering Tips:**
- Use a small amount of solder to bridge the pads for the jumper you want to close.
- Only one jumper needs to be closed for each address change (see table above).
- Power cycle the button after changing the jumper.

##### 2. Digitally: Using Software to Change Address

You can also change the address in software (temporarily or permanently) using the example script `qwiic_button_ex6_changeI2CAddress.py` in the Lab 4 folder. This is useful if you want to reassign addresses without soldering.

Run the script and follow the prompts:
```bash
python qwiic_button_ex6_changeI2CAddress.py
```
Enter the new address (e.g., 5B for 0x5B) when prompted. Power cycle the button after changing the address.

**Note:** The software method is less foolproof and you need to make sure to keep track of which button has which address!


##### Using Multiple Buttons in Code

After setting unique addresses, you can use multiple buttons in your script. See these example scripts in the Lab 4 folder:

- **`qwiic_1_button.py`**: Basic example for reading a single Qwiic Button (default address 0x6F). Run with:
	```bash
	python qwiic_1_button.py
	```

- **`qwiic_button_led_demo.py`**: Demonstrates using two Qwiic Buttons at different addresses (e.g., 0x6F and 0x6E) and controlling their LEDs. Button 1 toggles its own LED; Button 2 toggles both LEDs. Run with:
	```bash
	python qwiic_button_led_demo.py
	```

Here is a minimal code example for two buttons:
```python
import qwiic_button

# Default button (0x6F)
button1 = qwiic_button.QwiicButton()
# Button with A0 soldered (0x6E)
button2 = qwiic_button.QwiicButton(0x6E)

button1.begin()
button2.begin()

while True:
		if button1.is_button_pressed():
				print("Button 1 pressed!")
		if button2.is_button_pressed():
				print("Button 2 pressed!")
```

##### PCF8574 GPIO Expander: Add More Pins Over I²C

Sometimes your Pi’s header GPIO pins are already full (e.g., with a display or HAT). That’s where an I²C GPIO expander comes in handy.

We use the Adafruit PCF8574 I²C GPIO Expander, which gives you 8 extra digital pins over I²C. It’s a great way to prototype with LEDs, buttons, or other components on the breadboard without worrying about pin conflicts—similar to how Arduino users often expand their pinouts when prototyping physical interactions.

**Why is this useful?**
- You only need two wires (I²C: SDA + SCL) to unlock 8 extra GPIOs.
- It integrates smoothly with CircuitPython and Blinka.
- It allows a clean prototyping workflow when the Pi’s 40-pin header is already occupied by displays, HATs, or sensors.
- Makes breadboard setups feel more like an Arduino-style prototyping environment where it’s easy to wire up interaction elements.

**Demo Script:** `Lab 4/gpio_expander.py`

<p align="center">
    <img src="gpio_leds.gif" alt="GPIO Expander LED Demo" width="400"/>
</p>

We connected 8 LEDs (through 220 Ω resistors) to the expander and ran a little light show. The script cycles through three patterns:
- Chase (one LED at a time, left to right)
- Knight Rider (back-and-forth sweep)
- Disco (random blink chaos)

Every few runs, the script swaps to the next pattern automatically:
```bash
python gpio_expander.py
```

This is a playful way to visualize how the expander works, but the same technique applies if you wanted to prototype buttons, switches, or other interaction elements. It’s a lightweight, flexible addition to your prototyping toolkit.
